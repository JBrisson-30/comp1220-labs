"""Problem 2 - The Euclidean algorithm (10 points)     Sections 5.2 and 5.5

Section 5.2, Question 3 describes the Euclidean algorithm for the greatest
common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers X and Y:

    As long as neither X nor Y is zero, replace the LARGER of the two with
    the remainder of dividing the larger by the smaller. When one of them
    becomes zero, the GCD is the other (non-zero) value.

Python's remainder operator is %.   Example: 48 % 18 == 12
Do NOT use math.gcd.
