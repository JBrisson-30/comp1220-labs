"""Problem 4 - Insertion sort (25 points)                   Section 5.4

Translate the insertion sort pseudocode (Figure 5.11) into Python.

Rules:
  * Sort the list IN PLACE: shuffle entries within the list you were given.
    Do not build a second list.
  * Do NOT use sort(), sorted(), min(), max(), insert(), pop(), copy(),
    list(), or any import that sorts.
  * Use the book's plan: the pivot starts at the SECOND entry; save the
    pivot in a temporary variable (this leaves a "hole"); slide larger
    names down into the hole; drop the pivot into the hole.
  * Count COMPARISONS: each time you compare an entry in the list with the
    pivot ("is the name above the hole greater than the pivot?"), add 1.
    Return that count.

Hint: Python lists start at index 0, so the book's "2nd entry" is index 1.
